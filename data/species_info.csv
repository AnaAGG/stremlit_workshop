Fucus serratus,"Fucus serratus, the toothed wrack, is a robust, olive-brown shrubby seaweed that grows in high densities low on the seashore. The fronds are about 2 cm wide, splitting in two repeatedly. The fronds bear no air bladders. The whole plant typically grows to about 60 cm long. The fronds have a serrated edge and grow from a short stalk."," Fronds are flat and straplike with a well developed mid-rib. Fronds edged with sharp, forward-pointing serrations. The frond bears no air bladders. The frond surface has numerous pin-pricks with clusters of tiny white hairs. Receptacles form slightly thickened patches about 4 cm long surrounded by a sterile border at the terminal end of the frond.","Global distribution
Northern Portugal and the Atlantic coast of France; British Isles, North Sea coasts and into the western Baltic; Scandinavia up to Novaya Zemlya; Iceland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the western north Atlantic."
Ascophyllum nodosum,"A common large brown seaweed, dominant on sheltered rocky shores. The species has long strap like fronds with large egg-shaped air bladders at regular intervals. The fronds of Ascophyllum nodosum are typically between 0.5 and 2m in length. The species often bears tufts of the small reddish-brown filamentous epiphytic algae Polysiphonia lanosa. Ascophyllum nodosum occurs on the middle of the shore, often with Fucus vesiculosus. The species grows slowly and plants can live to be several decades old. Individual fronds can become up to 15 years old before breakage.", Frond narrow without midrib. Large swollen egg shaped air bladders at intervals along middle of the frond. Reproductive bodies rounded on short stalks. Dichotomously branched.,"Global distribution
Global distribution is restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. Its northern limits are the White Sea in the east and Baffin Island in the west. Southern distributions extend to northern Portugal and New Jersey."
Chondrus crispus,"Chondrus crispus is a small purplish-red seaweed (up to 22 cm long) found on rocky shores and in pools. The fronds grow dichotomously from a narrow, unbranched stipe and are flat and wide with rounded tips. This seaweed is highly variable in appearance depending on the level of wave exposure of the shore and has a tendency to turn green in strong sunlight. Underwater, the tips of the frond can be iridescent."," Thallus with discoid holdfast and erect fronds arising in tufts. Un-branched stipe gradually expanding into fan-like blade. Fronds repeatedly dichotomous (up to 5 times) with rounded axils, usually expanding but occasionally tapering towards rounded apices. Female fruiting bodies (carposporangia) occur terminally in cystocarps that protrude strongly as concave-convex swellings 2 mm in diameter. Form highly variable depending on environment.","Global distribution

Fucus vesiculosus,"The bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus is a large brown algae, common on the middle shore. It can be found in high densities living for about 4-5 years (S. Kraan, pers. comm.). Under sheltered conditions, the fronds have been known to grow up to 2 m in Maine, America (Wippelhauser, 1996)."," Frond with prominent midrib and almost spherical air bladders. Air bladders usually paired but may be absent in very small plants. Margin of frond smooth. Dichotomously branched. The species may be confused with Fucus spiralis with which it hybridizes. A bladderless form occurs on more wave exposed shores (S. Kraan, pers. comm.).","Global distribution
"
Fucus spiralis,"An intertidal brown seaweed, found on the high shore. It grows up to 40 cm long, without air bladders and lives for up to 4 years. The species can tolerate a high level of desiccation. Fronds have a characteristic ridge along the edge of the receptacles."," Frond with smooth margin. Prominent midrib. Without air bladders. Frond often twisted. Round reproductive bodies at ends of branches, which are almost round in outline and surrounded by a narrow rim of sterile frond.","Global distribution
Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Atlantic coast of France, Spain, Morocco, Azores, East coast of America from New Jersey to Nova Scotia and isolated reports in the Northern Pacific."
Pelvetia canaliculata,A common brown seaweed found high on the shore. It is very tolerant of desiccation surviving up to 8 days out of the water. Pelvetia canaliculata lives for about 4 years and grows up to 15 cm long. The fronds of the algae are curled longitudinally forming a channel., Frond curled longitudinally to form a distinct channel. Without midrib or airbladders. Reproductive bodies at ends of branches. Dichotomously branched.,"Global distribution
Norway, Iceland, UK, Ireland, Atlantic coast of France, Spain and Portugal."
