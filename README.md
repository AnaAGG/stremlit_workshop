In this repo we are going to learn how to create a web application using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). 

**Streamlit** is an open Python package that will help us to create interactive web applications without any knowledge of html or CSS, i.e. Python will be the only thing we will need!

To do this example I used a worldwide seaweed information with the objetive to characterice their distribution and introduce a little description of each species cointained in the dataset. 

In this repo you can see two examples of streamlit app:
    1. The macroalgae library -> in this folder we find the basic concepts to get started with streamlit
    2. Iris species predictive species -> an example of how to create and load a machine learning model in streamlit.
