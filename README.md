# stremlit_workshop

In this repo we are going to learn how to create a web application using [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). 

**Streamlit** is an open Python package that will help us to create interactive web applications without any knowledge of html or CSS, i.e. Python will be the only thing we will need!

To do this example I used a worldwide seaweed information with the objetive to characterice their distribution and introduce a little description of each species cointained in the dataset. 

In this repo you can see two examples of streamlit app:
    1. The macroalgae library
    2. Iris species predictive species
